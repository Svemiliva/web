/*Lists
● Markers
○ Create four lists (two unordered and two ordered lists)
○ The first unordered list should have circles as item markers
○ The second one (unordered) should use squares as markers
○ The third one (ordered) should use upper alphabetics
○ The last list (ordered) should use the Roman numbers
● Image Marker/Position
○ Create two additional unordered lists
○ Set images as item markers for both of the lists
○ Both lists should be 200px wide, and should have a lot of text in each
item
○ The markers in the second list should be inside a box*/
